# ToDoList-WhatsApp
Hey there! This repository contains the code for a WhatsApp bot. This bot will basically let you add tasks to a list and remove them. It formats them in a clear readable manner.
All the code is clearly documented.

# Tweaking The Code
This project uses the Twilio API to send and receive WhatsApp messages. Since the basic function of sending WhatsApp messages is the same, you can use the basic project structure to add your own functionality. Eg. An AI chatbot can be implemented.

# Using The Bot
### Python Packages required:
1. twilio (pip install twilio)
2. flask (pip install flask)

### Usage Instructions:
1. Download the code and run the create database file.
